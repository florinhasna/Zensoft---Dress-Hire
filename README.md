Our Fancy dress Hire system works by first getting the merchant to Login, by entering their ID and PIN. Then, the staff menu will appear. 
Staff can issue and return products, view status of products, view specific customer's borrows and add new customers. 
We are using Hash maps to have the IDs of all customers, merchants and porducts act as our keys, which then retrive all information on them.
